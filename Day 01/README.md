# Day 1: Introduction to CUDA & Basic GPU Queries

## Key Learnings
I learned how to initialize the CUDA runtime and query GPU device properties. I wrote a program that lists details like total global memory, number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs), warp size, and thread limits for each GPU. This helps me understand the GPU's hardware capabilities before launching any CUDA kernels.
